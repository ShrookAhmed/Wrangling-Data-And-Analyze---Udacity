Project 2: Wrangle And Analyze Data - WERATEDOGS Twitter ACCOUNT 

<h1> Project Overview </h1>

The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs.
WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10.The numerator is always greater than 10 (10/10,15/10,13/10) and so on.

<h2>Project Acceptance Criterion</h2>

<h3>Assessing Data for this Project</h3>
    
    -Detect and document at least eight (8) quality issues.
 
    -Two (2) tidiness issues in your wrangle_act.ipynb Jupyter Notebook.
   
<h3>Cleaning Data for this Project</h3>  

     -Clean each of the issues you documented while assessing.
    
     -The result should be a high quality and tidy master pandas DataFrame (or DataFrames, if appropriate).
    
<h3>Storing, Analyzing, and Visualizing Data for this Project</h3>

    -Store the clean DataFrame(s) in a CSV file with the main one named twitter_archive_master.csv.

<h3>Analyze and visualize your wrangled data.</h3>

    -At least three (3) insights and
  
    -one (1) visualization must be produced
  
<h3>Reporting for this Project</h3>

    -Create a word-at least 250 word- written report called wrangle_report.pdf or wrangle_report.
    html that briefly describes your wrangling efforts. This is to be framed as an internal document.
  
    -Create a 250-word-minimum written report called act_report.pdf or act_report.
    html that communicates the insights and displays the visualization(s) produced from your wrangled data. This is to be framed as an external document, 
    like a blog post or magazine article, for example.
